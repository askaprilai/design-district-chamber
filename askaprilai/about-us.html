                    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                    <p>Founded by April Sabral, a former retail executive with over 30 years of experience, Ask April AI started with a simple observation: leaders were constantly reaching out for advice through late-night texts and calls.</p>
                    <p>April realized her "Just Ask April" approach wasn't scalable. Leaders needed access to proven leadership strategies 24/7, not just when she was available to respond.</p>
                    <p>This insight led to the creation of a comprehensive leadership training platform that combines courses, coaching, and AI support to empower leaders in retail, hospitality, and service industries.</p>

                <div class="founder-text">
                    <p>With over 30 years in retail, April Sabral has trained everyone from store managers to vice presidents, working with brands such as Jimmy Choo, Tory Burch, Sunglass Hut, Psycho Bunny and boutique retailers like Elan Flowers in New York.</p>
                    <p>Throughout her career, she noticed a pattern: most managers were promoted because they could sell—not because they knew how to lead. April's gift is simplifying leadership into clear, repeatable systems. She created tools like the Nine-Step Accountability Wheel to help managers shift ownership, reclaim their time, and empower their teams to deliver results.</p>
                    <p>That's why she built Ask April—to provide the exact tools, coaching, and mindset shifts needed to turn good managers into confident leaders. No fluff. Just what works on the floor.</p>
